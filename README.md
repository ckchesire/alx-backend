# Backend Techniques

## Paging and HATEOAS
This repository demonstrates how to implement **pagination** and **HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)** in RESTful APIs to enhance scalability, usability, and client navigation. It includes both offset-based (e.g., `?page=2&limit=10`) and cursor-based pagination strategies, allowing clients to efficiently navigate large datasets. Each paginated response includes metadata such as total items, current page, and page limits. The project is structured for clarity and supports configuration of page sizes and limits.

HATEOAS is integrated to enrich API responses with dynamic navigational links such as `self`, `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`, making client-side logic simpler and more discoverable. This allows consumers of the API to understand what actions are possible without prior knowledge of the API structure. The project includes sample endpoints, test instructions using tools like Postman, and optional Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for exploring endpoints.
